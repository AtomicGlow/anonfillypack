= Anonfilly Pack - Somehow Not Dead =

This is an addon pack made for MineLittlePony in order to turn pony villagers into everyone's favorite horse board mascot.

Features:
-All Current Villagers in various unique races!
    See Pony Spotting Guide Below

-Wandering traders!

-Seven Pranks Later based Zombies, thanks to L&T. (Best with some kind of emmisive texture support.)
(With alternative Pumpkin head zombies for a few villager types.)
-Color Coded Villager Clothing, hopefully still different enough for colorblind people.

-Three unused folders, Pegasi_Disabled, Alicorn_Disabled, and Unicorn_Disabled; made for people who dislike one of my exotic Anon choices. Just delete the villager type you don't like and rename the alternative.
