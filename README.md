= Anonfilly Pack - Somehow Not Dead... and Somehow Still WIP =

This is an addon pack made for MineLittlePony in order to turn pony villagers into everyone's favorite horse board mascot.

Features:
-All Current Villagers in various unique races!
    See Pony Spotting Guide Below

-Wandering traders!

-Abominable Pumpkin Zombies based on L&T. (Best with some kind of emmisive texture support.)

-Color Coded Villager Clothing, but differing and consistent details that hopefully make them recognizable for the colorblind.

-Two unused folders, Pegasi_Disabled and Unicorn_Disabled; made for people who dislike one of my exotic Anon choices.



== Pony Spotting Guide ==

Types:
    Desert - Saddle Arabian. Big Unicorn
    Jungle (Does not have villages in vanilla) - Kirin
    Plains - Erf Horses
    Savanna - Zony, Although I took inspiration mostly from the crazy leg pattern Zonkies can get.
    Snow - Snowpity
    Swamp (Does not have villages in vanilla) - Bats
    Taiga - Caribou/Reindeer Anon

            (Support for Unemployed(none.png) villagers requires an updated version of MineLP, so older releases might not work properly.)

=== To Do ===

Finish Kirin
Improve Snow Pony and Reindeer Outfits
Finish Improving Saddle Arabian/Desert Textures
Add Big Snow Pony as an alternative for Reindeer?
Better Zony Texture? I tried zebra, but couldn't make zebra anon work in skin form. Suggestions always welcome.
